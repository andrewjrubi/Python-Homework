#Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

#The total number of months included in the dataset.

index = budget_data.index
number_of_months = len(index)

print('Total Months: ', number_of_months)

#The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

sum1 = budget_data['Profit/Losses'].sum()
print('Total Profit/Loss: $', sum1)

#The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

mean1 = budget_data['Profit/Losses'].mean()
mean_rounded = round(mean1,2)
print('Averge Change: $', mean_rounded)

#Another way to calculate average
#average1 = sum1/86
#print(average1)

#The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

max1 = budget_data['Profit/Losses'].max()
print('Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012', '($',max1,')')

#The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
